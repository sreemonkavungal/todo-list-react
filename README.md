# todo-list-react
This project was built using React and Redux, and allows users to create and manage their to-do lists.
To build this app, I used React to create reusable components for rendering the list, input fields, and buttons. I also used Redux to manage the state of the app, which includes the list of to-do items and their corresponding statuses (e.g. completed, not completed).
One of the key features of this app is its dynamic behavior. As you add, complete, or delete items from the list, the app immediately updates the state and renders the changes in real time. This makes it easy to keep track of your to-do list and stay organized.
